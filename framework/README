README for the final game framework
-----------------------------------

The goal of this framework is to integrate the work of all programming
teams into our game "enigma3d". To make this possible, this framework
provides the entire "infrastructure" of the game, so that each team
has their own set of files they work on.

 * For each student we have reserved one field number XXX according to
   the file "Chart-of-fields" in the svn repository. (Please notify us
   if you are not in the chart!) 

 * When in a team you may use any of the numbers of the team
   members. Group hand-in is allowed, but remember groups may have max
   4 members!

 * The following assumes you are working on field number XXX. The
   files belonging to this field are called TXXX.cpp and TXXX.h.
   *******************************************************************
   YOU MUST NOT change any other files than the ones belonging to your
   group, because otherwise the integration of the works is not
   possible. 
   *******************************************************************

 * If any team has a problem integrating their work into the game by
   changing only their TXX.cpp/.h, they MUST contact us; then we will
   find a solution, in the worst case with that team's work not being
   integrated with the rest.

 * Please do look carefully through all the central files of the program and 
   their comments to understand how the game works:
   - game.cpp / game.h
   - field.cpp / field.h 
   - main.cpp

   Please consider in particular the example fields we provide: T1--T4
   These latter two are very much like how your TXXX.cpp/TXXX.h should
   look like. You are welcome to copy any of the code from these existing 
   files and re-use it in your TXXX.cpp/TXXX.h. 

 * You see in the code, that the name of the class that team TXXX would
   build is TXXX, and the unique identifier for that Field is tTXXX that
   should return upon getFieldIdentifier(). You must not change that.

 * Every group should write a level file (modifying
   enigma3d.app/Contents/Resources/field.lvl) in which the own kind of
   Field occurs. The field entry in the level file should simply be
   the group number XXX.

 * Before compiling look at the Makefile: check the system you are
   building for and the path of irrlicht

 * The first compile requires every of the 150 declared fields is
   compiled, which takes quite some time. After that only modified
   files will be compiled and that's faster.
   
 * FINAL SUBMISSION: send to your teaching favourite assistant:
   - your TXXX.h 
   - your TXXX.cpp 
   - your field.lvl -- renamed to TXXX.lvl
   - any textures/etc. your stone uses

 * If your team works on more than one Field type, ask the teaching
   assistants for reserving additional names/identifiers for you.

 * MOST IMPORTANT: Any problems, clarifications, questions : contact us!!
